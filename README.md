# MAgNet: Mesh-Agnostic Neural PDE Solver
This is the official repository to the paper "MAgNet: Mesh-Agnostic Neural PDE Solver". In this paper, we aim to address the problem of learning solutions to Pratial Differential Equations (PDE) while also generalizing to any mesh or resolution at test-time. This effectively enables us to generate predictions at any point of the PDE domain.
